# SEO content policy

Read this before adding a page, a page template, or a sitemap entry.

Google AdSense has turned `grandprixpicks.com` down three times for **"low
value content"** — 2026-08-02, 2026-08-13 and 2026-09-06. The console gives no
dates, no per-URL detail and no reviewer notes beyond four boilerplate policy
links, so the only way to know where the site stands is to measure prod
yourself. The rules below are what those measurements said, and they are
binding on SEO work until a review passes.

## What the measurements found

Taken 2026-09-06 against all 82 sitemap URLs (fetch each, strip
`<script>`/`<style>`/`<head>`, strip tags, then drop the 135 words of shared
chrome — 20 header + 115 footer — because raw word counts flatter every page by
that much).

**The site grew in the direction it was rejected for.** 51 URLs in August, 82 in
September, and 59 of those 82 (72%) were one of four templates, up from 65% at
the previous rejection. Each round of "fix the thin content" had added pages.

**Length was not the problem.** Nothing was under 189 content words. The four
`/guides` explainers ran 750-1160.

**Sibling duplication was not the problem either.** Within a template, pages
shared 17-35% of their body text with each other — normal, and not the
scaled-content-abuse signal it can look like. Repeated driver-name sequences in
results tables make naive shingle comparisons look far worse than reality;
always subtract the chrome before comparing.

**Cross-template duplication was the problem.** About **70% of every circuit
page's body text was reproduced verbatim on the corresponding race page**
(73% Albert Park / Australia, 72% Lusail / Qatar, 71% Red Bull Ring / Austria,
19 of 23 in the 67-74% band). The circuit page was a strict _subset_ of a page
that also carried the schedule, the classification and the picks — 23 URLs, 28%
of the sitemap, asking to be indexed for content already published somewhere
stronger.

## Rules

1. **A new page must carry something no other page on this site carries.** Not
   a new arrangement of facts that already exist here. Before adding one, run
   the duplication check below against the pages it will sit beside.

2. **When two pages overlap, the weaker one canonicalises to the stronger and
   leaves the sitemap.** It stays reachable and linked for players; it just
   stops competing. Two implementations of exactly this, and the shape to copy:
   `raceWriteupSeo.ts` (race page → write-up) and `circuitPageSeo.ts`
   (circuit page → race). Never build a canonical chain: point at the page that
   is itself indexed.

3. **Do not add a fifth template.** Bulk-generated per-entity pages are what
   the site already has too many of, and Google treats machine-scaled
   templating as an abuse signal in its own right.

4. **Do not write another `/guides` explainer.** They fail on authority, not
   content — see `project_seo_guides_rank_not_content` in memory. A fifth
   becomes a fifth zero-impression page and cannibalises the one guide already
   pulling 18% of site impressions.

5. **Prefer subtraction.** Removing 23 near-duplicate URLs did more for the
   template ratio than any amount of new prose, and it costs no editorial
   review.

6. **Prefer first-party data to explanation.** Explaining Formula 1 puts the
   site in competition with publications that have covered the sport for
   decades, and it loses: sitewide average position is 57, which is page 6.
   What we hold and nobody else publishes is **how our players picked** — the
   finishing order a few hundred people expected, which is a different fact
   from the order that happened. `consensus.ts` and `SessionConsensus.tsx` are
   the first surface built on that principle; it is the direction for the rest.

7. **Server-render anything a reviewer or a crawler needs to see.** A `<Link>`
   or a paragraph behind a client `useQuery` is absent from the SSR HTML. This
   has bitten the site twice: it orphaned all 11 practice pages, and it left
   every unopened round's server HTML ending in the placeholder "Check back
   soon" instead of a real date.

8. **Never expose picks before a session locks.** `getSessionConsensus` returns
   null until the deadline. Publishing the crowd's order early would turn
   picking into copying and flatten the leaderboard it feeds. This is a product
   rule, not an SEO one, and it outranks any indexation argument.

## How to measure

```
curl -s https://grandprixpicks.com/sitemap.xml | grep -o '<loc>[^<]*</loc>' | sed 's/<[^>]*>//g'
```

Fetch each URL, strip scripts/styles/head, strip tags, drop the shared chrome
(compute it as the common word prefix and suffix across all pages — do not
hardcode 135, it moves when the header or footer changes), then report:

- content words per page, ascending;
- for each templated group, the share of 5-word shingles each page shares with
  a **sibling** in the group;
- for each page, the single other page on the site it overlaps most with. This
  last one is what found the circuit problem, and the sibling-only comparison
  missed it entirely.

## Before requesting another review

- Deploy first. The 2026-08-13 rejection graded the pre-fix site because the
  review was requested before the content deploy landed.
- Wait for Search Console to show the changes indexed. Repeat requests with no
  substantive change slow subsequent ones.
- The 22 circuit guides and the evergreen guides were written by Claude and are
  **not fact-checked**. That is a standing risk on an editorial review.
