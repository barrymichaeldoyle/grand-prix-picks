# Grand Prix Picks

Before writing or changing any user-facing copy, read
`docs/product-voice.md`. Treat its rules and examples as acceptance criteria.
Do not invent helper text, headings, taglines, or explanatory prose unless the
feature requires them.

Before adding a page, a page template or a sitemap entry, read
`docs/seo-content-policy.md`. AdSense has rejected the site three times for
"low value content", and the measured cause is duplicate and templated pages,
not short ones — so the answer is almost never another page.

F1 prediction game where users pick their top 5 drivers for each session of a
race weekend and earn points based on accuracy. Beyond the core Top 5 game it
also has teammate Head-to-Head (H2H) picks, private leagues, an activity feed,
following/followers, a paid season pass, and push + in-app notifications.

## Monorepo Layout

pnpm workspace (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`) with `apps/*` and `packages/*`:

```
apps/
  web/        # TanStack Router + Vite web app (SSR via Nitro, deployed to Cloudflare Pages)
  mobile/     # Expo / React Native app (iOS + Android, also runs on web via Expo)
  backend/    # Convex backend (schema, queries/mutations, scoring, emails)
packages/
  shared/     # Code shared between web + mobile (e.g. session types, scoring constants)
convex/       # Root-level _generated only — actual Convex code lives in apps/backend/convex
```

Workspace package names:

- `@grandprixpicks/web`
- `@grandprixpicks/mobile`
- `@grandprixpicks/backend`
- `@grandprixpicks/shared`

## Tech Stack

### Web (`apps/web`)

- React 19 + TanStack Router (file-based routing) + TanStack Query
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Vite 7 + Nitro (SSR)
- Cloudflare Pages (via Wrangler)
- Sentry error monitoring
- Playwright (E2E), Vitest (unit), Storybook (component)

### Mobile (`apps/mobile`)

- Expo SDK ~57 + React Native 0.86
- React Navigation (native-stack + bottom-tabs)
- `@clerk/clerk-expo` for auth
- `react-native-mmkv` for storage, `react-native-nitro-modules`
- `expo-notifications`, `expo-apple-authentication`, `expo-haptics`, `expo-secure-store`
- Available Expo skills: `expo-dev-client`, `expo-deployment`, `expo-module`, `building-native-ui`, `expo-tailwind-setup`, `expo-cicd-workflows`, `upgrading-expo`, `use-dom`, `native-data-fetching`, `expo-api-routes`

### Backend (`apps/backend`)

- Convex (backend-as-a-service with real-time subscriptions)
- Clerk for auth (OpenID Connect, JWT verification)
- React Email for transactional emails
- Paddle for billing (season pass) — webhooks verified in the web server layer
- Expo push + web push for notifications

## Commands (run from repo root)

- `pnpm dev` — Web dev (Vite on port 3000); also: `pnpm dev:web`, `pnpm dev:mobile` (Expo), `pnpm dev:backend` (Convex)
- `pnpm ios` / `pnpm android` — Launch Expo on simulator
- `pnpm build` — Web production build
- `pnpm test` — Vitest across shared, backend and web. Narrow it with
  `pnpm test:shared` / `test:backend` / `test:web`. Mobile is separate
  (`pnpm test:mobile`) because it needs its own environment.
- `pnpm test:e2e` — Playwright (web only)
- `pnpm lint` / `pnpm lint:fix` — oxlint across web + backend + mobile
- `pnpm format` / `pnpm check` — oxfmt (format / check both)
- `pnpm typecheck` — TS across shared, web, backend (mobile has its own `pnpm --filter @grandprixpicks/mobile typecheck`)
- `pnpm knip` — Detect unused code/exports
- `pnpm storybook` — Storybook on port 6006
- `pnpm deploy` / `pnpm deploy:backend` — Cloudflare Pages / Convex prod
  (manual, web-only / backend-only — see Deploys below before reaching for these)

## Deploys

**A push to `main` deploys everything.** Cloudflare Pages runs
`scripts/cloudflare-build.sh`, which deploys **Convex first**, smoke-tests
OpenF1, runs prod migrations, then builds the web client against the backend
that is already live. Web and backend ship together from one commit, in the
right order, with no manual step. Do not tell the user a backend change is
"still pending" after a normal push, and do not offer to run `pnpm
deploy:backend` for them: that is the same deploy done twice.

The manual scripts are the exception, not the norm:

- `pnpm deploy` builds web locally and uploads it, from whatever branch you are
  on, skipping CI **and** skipping Convex. That is the one path that can leave
  prod web calling functions prod Convex does not have.
- `pnpm deploy:backend` is for deploying Convex by hand when Cloudflare is down.

Verify rather than assume: `npx convex function-spec --prod` shows what is
actually live. Full detail in `docs/convex-cicd.md`.

## Git Workflow

- **Work directly on `main`.** Do not create a feature branch, switch branches,
  or open a PR unless explicitly asked to. This overrides the default "branch
  before committing on the default branch" behaviour.
- If the repo is already on a non-`main` branch, stay on it — don't switch to
  `main` on your own either. Just don't create new branches unprompted.
- Committing and pushing still only happen when explicitly asked.

**Route co-location convention**: TanStack treats a leading `-` as "not a
route". Page-private components and hooks live in `-components/` and `-hooks/`
folders next to the route that owns them (see `races/$raceSlug/`). Promote to
top-level `components/` / `hooks/` only when shared across routes.

Many modules have co-located `*.test.ts` files (convex-test based).

## Domain Model

### Session Types

- `quali` — Qualifying (every weekend)
- `sprint_quali` — Sprint Qualifying (sprint weekends only)
- `sprint` — Sprint Race (sprint weekends only)
- `race` — Main Race (every weekend)

**Weekend order**: Sprint weekends: sprint_quali → sprint → quali → race. Regular: quali → race.

### Scoring (`apps/backend/convex/lib/scoring.ts`)

Users pick exactly 5 drivers per session. Scoring is **order-sensitive** — a pick's
points depend on its predicted position (slot 1–5) vs the driver's actual finishing
position. Points per pick, evaluated in order:

- **5 pts** — Exact position match
- **3 pts** — Off by exactly 1 position (this wins even when the driver finishes
  just outside the top 5, e.g. predicted P5, finished P6)
- **1 pt** — Driver finished in actual top 5, off by 2+
- **0 pts** — Otherwise (driver not in top 5 and not off-by-one)

Max 25 pts/session. Season leaderboard = sum of all session scores. Scoring is
identical across every session type (quali / sprint_quali / sprint / race) — there
is one `scoreTopFive()` and no per-session branching in the point math.

### Key Business Rules

- Users predict the **next upcoming race only**
- Each session locks independently at its start time
- Cascade mode: one submission applies to all sessions of a weekend
- Specific mode: edit picks for individual sessions
- Admin publishes results per session → auto-calculates all user scores
- Race status: `upcoming` → `locked` → `finished`
- **H2H**: per-session teammate matchups; pick a winner from each pair, 1 pt per
  correct pick. Fully implemented (predictions, scoring, leaderboard, race UI).
- **Lineups are round-scoped**: who drives for whom is a per-round fact, held in
  `driverTeamStints`, and `h2hMatchups` carry `fromRound`/`toRound` to match. A
  mid-season change closes the old records and opens new ones, so past races
  keep the grid, team colours, duels and constructor points they actually had.
  `drivers.team` is the driver's _current_ team, for display only: never use it
  to attribute a past result. Declare changes in `TEAMMATE_PAIRINGS_2026`
  (`packages/shared/src/teams.ts`), then run `convex run seed:applyLineup`.
  Follow it with `seed:migrateOrphanedH2HPicks` (dry-run first): picks already
  made on a retired pairing move to the pairing that replaced it, because a
  duel pick backs a **seat**, not a driver. Never leave players mid-way: a
  stale row makes an incomplete weekend read as complete and disables Save.
- **Leagues**: private leagues with a shareable slug; members get a league-scoped
  leaderboard and feed.
- **Season pass**: a paid (Paddle) per-season entitlement (`userSeasonPasses`)
  gates premium surfaces.
- **Feed**: activity events (score published, session locked, joined league,
  streak milestone); other users can react to an event with an emoji.

### Database Tables (Convex)

Grouped by area (25 tables):

- **Core game**: `users`, `drivers`, `races`, `predictions`, `results`, `scores`,
  `seasonStandings`, `driverTeamStints`
- **Head-to-head**: `h2hMatchups`, `h2hPredictions`, `h2hResults`, `h2hScores`,
  `h2hSeasonStandings`
- **Social**: `follows`, `feedEvents`, `revs`, `leagues`, `leagueMembers`
  (`revs` is the legacy table name for reactions; the feature is called
  **reactions** everywhere user-facing, and in `packages/shared/src/reactions.ts`)
- **Notifications**: `inAppNotifications`, `pushSubscriptions`, `expoPushTokens`
- **Billing / ops**: `userSeasonPasses`, `processedPaddleWebhookEvents`,
  `announcements`, `supportRequests`

## Data Fetching

No REST API routes. All data flows through Convex:

```tsx
// In route loaders (SSR, web)
const race = await convex.query(api.races.getNextRace);

// In components (real-time, web + mobile)
const predictions = useQuery(api.predictions.myWeekendPredictions, { raceId });
const result = useMutation(api.predictions.submitPrediction);
```

## Code Conventions

- **Named exports only** — default exports banned (lint rule), except route files and config
- **Linter**: oxlint (`.oxlintrc.json`), **Formatter**: oxfmt — use `pnpm lint:fix` / `pnpm format` rather than reordering by hand
- **Path alias** — `@/*` maps to `./src/*` within each app
- Sentry instrumentation (web): wrap server functions with `Sentry.startSpan`
- Convex validators: use `v` from `convex/values`

## Storybook

- Component stories in `*.stories.tsx` files alongside web components

<!-- convex-ai-start -->

This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read
`convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on
how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that
override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running
`npx convex ai-files install`.
