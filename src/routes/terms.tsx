            </h2>
            <p>
              Grand Prix Picks is a fan-made, non-commercial prediction game
              where users predict the top 5 finishers for Formula 1 races and
              earn points based on accuracy. The app is provided for
              entertainment only and is not affiliated with Formula 1, the FIA,
              or any related entities.

            </h2>
            <p>
              You must be old enough to form a binding contract in your
              jurisdiction to use the app. You are responsible for keeping your
              account credentials secure and for all activity under your
              account. One account per person; do not create multiple accounts
              to gain an unfair advantage.

            </h2>
            <p>
              You agree to use the app in good faith and not to cheat, abuse
              bugs, manipulate scores, or harass other users. Please choose a
              username that is respectful; we discourage offensive, hateful,
              discriminatory, or otherwise inappropriate usernames. We may
              remove predictions, adjust scores, change or remove usernames, or
              suspend or terminate accounts if we reasonably believe you have
              violated these terms or abused the service.

            </h2>
            <p>
              Predictions must be submitted before the deadline set for each
              race. Once a race is locked, predictions cannot be changed.
              Scoring rules are defined within the app and may be updated; we
              will use reasonable efforts to communicate material changes.
