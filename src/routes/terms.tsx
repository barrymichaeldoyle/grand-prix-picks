            </h2>
            <p>
              Grand Prix Picks is a fan-made, non-commercial prediction game
              where users predict the top 5 finishers for Formula 1 races and
              earn points based on accuracy. The app is provided for
              entertainment only and is not affiliated with Formula 1, the FIA,
              or any related entities.

              You agree to use the app in good faith and not to cheat, abuse
              bugs, manipulate scores, or harass other users. We may remove
              predictions, adjust scores, or suspend or terminate accounts if we
              reasonably believe you have violated these terms or abused the
              service.

              Scoring rules are defined within the app and may be updated; we
              will use reasonable efforts to communicate material changes.
