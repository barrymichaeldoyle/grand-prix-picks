/**
 * The panel that ends a race write-up.
 *
 * It knows the weekend's phase and, since the write-ups are what search sends
 * people to, now also who is reading. A signed-in player who had already picked
 * this round was being told to go and make picks, which reads as a site that
 * does not know them; `raceId` is what lets it say otherwise.
 *
 * The prediction lookup is viewer-scoped and therefore client-only: it returns
 * null for an anonymous reader rather than throwing, so the write-up routes
 * stay Clerk-free and the panel server-renders its signed-out wording. When the
 * query resolves for a signed-in reader the panel settles on the state that
 * mentions their picks. Nothing below depends on it — the primary action goes
 * to the same race page either way — so the correction is a wording change, not
 * a layout shift.
