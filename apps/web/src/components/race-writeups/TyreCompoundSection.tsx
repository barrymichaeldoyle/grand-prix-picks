 * land near the width of the four-up stats strip and the two read as the same
 * component: gap-px cells on a border fill, figure in mono over a tracked
 * micro label.
 *
 * Showing all five is what makes it worth a graphic. Three cells would say
 * "C3, C4 and C5 are hard, medium and soft", a mapping the heading can carry
 * on its own. Five cells say where those three sit, so "the softest three"
 * stops being a claim the reader takes on trust and the relative naming stops
 * confusing: the eye can see that Monza's hard tyre is the middle of the range.
 *
 * The sidewall band is a 3px top rule per cell rather than a drawn ring: flat,
 * and on-system as the coloured column marker the scoring-band card already
 * uses. The two compounds that stay at home keep the rule at the same weight
 * but dashed, which is what a dashed hairline means everywhere else here: the
 * slot exists and there is nothing in it. They take the sunken fill rather
 * than the page colour, because a transparent cell has no bottom edge of its
 * own and left the strip visibly missing its bottom-left corner.
