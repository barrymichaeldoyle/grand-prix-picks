 * button) and nothing else: the leaderboard, which is the reason to make picks
 * at all, was not linked from any of the five.
 *
 * The clicks are measured because the reason for the change is a claim about
 * acquisition — that a reader who arrives from a search for "monza
 * predictions" will go on to the game — and that claim is worth more as a
 * funnel than as an opinion. Route pageviews already carry the write-up path,
