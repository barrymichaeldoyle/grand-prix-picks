/**
 * Where the season goes after this weekend, on a finished write-up.
 *
 * `race-writeup-lifecycle.md` asks an archived page to link the next round,
 * and it was the one instruction the finished pages did not follow: a reader
 * who arrived from search for a race that has already run reached the bottom
 * of the piece and found links to this round's picks and the leaderboard, both
 * of which are now closed to them. The round they can still play is the one
 * thing the page did not offer.
 *
 * Prefers the next round's own write-up and falls back to its race page, so a
 * weekend nobody has written a piece for still gets a link rather than being
 * skipped. Renders nothing at the end of a season, which is the honest answer
 * when there is no next round.
 *
 * Loader data, like everything else on these pages that is a link: a
 * `useQuery` here would be absent from the SSR HTML and the forward link would
 * exist for readers and not for crawlers, which is the failure that orphaned
 * the practice pages.
