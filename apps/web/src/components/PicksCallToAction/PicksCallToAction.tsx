/**
 * The panel that ends a public reference page, pointed at a surface that takes

 *
 * ## Why it branches on the viewer
 *
 * None of the public pages knew who was reading them. That produced the two
 * bad cases this fixes: a signed-in reader was pitched the game they had
 * already joined, and a reader with picks already in was told to go and make
 * them. `useViewerSession` is the Clerk-free way to ask — it reads the
 * SSR-resolved signal and Clerk's client state through a plain context, so it
 * works on the routes in `clerk-free-routes.ts` without putting the auth
 * runtime on the page for an anonymous visitor.
 *
 * ## Why the destination can be the hub
 *
 * A page cached as static content must not name a specific round in its SSR
 * HTML: the edge holds that markup for an hour, and a race slug baked into it
 * goes stale inside the window. Those callers pass no `raceSlug` and get
 * `/f1-predictions-this-weekend`, which is a stable URL that resolves the round
 * itself. Callers already loading race data pass the slug and get a direct
 * link. Either way the link is in the server-rendered HTML, so a crawler sees
 * it — a `<Link>` behind a client-only query is not there at all.
