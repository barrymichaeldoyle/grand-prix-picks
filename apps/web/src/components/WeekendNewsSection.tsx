 * What changed this weekend, read from `raceNews` rather than written into the

 *
 * These items used to be hand-written sections here *and* published to the
 * feed, which is the same fact in two places and the classic way one of them
 * goes stale: a penalty firming up from "ten places minimum" to "confirmed back
 * of grid" would have needed editing twice. Publishing once now updates both.
 *
 * What stays hand-written is everything that is not a discrete sourced event:
 * an ongoing situation like a fitness watch, colour like a tribute livery, and
 * the circuit analysis. Those are prose, they have no `affectsSessions` answer,
 * and the feed is deliberately not the place for them.
 *
 * A card is a headline, the story, and where it came from. It also carried
 * driver badges and a "worth revisiting" impact line, and stacked one column
 * wide on a phone that was two labelled rows and a rule wrapped around two
 * sentences: the badges repeated codes the headline had already named, and the
 * impact line said "Qualifying and Race" for nearly every item. The driver
 * survives as the team colour on the card's edge, which is the one thing the
 * headline cannot say at a glance, and `affectsSessions` is still required when
 * publishing (see `docs/race-news.md`) and still shown in the feed.
