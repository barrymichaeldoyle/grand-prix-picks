/**
 * Every write-up route on disk is in the registry.
 *
 * The checks around write-ups all iterate `listRaceWriteups()`, so they read
 * outward from the registry and a route file that was never registered is
 * invisible to all of them. That file is the one shape that puts two
 * indexable pages on the same query: `getRaceWriteup` returns null for the
 * weekend, so the race page keeps asking to be indexed and stays in the
 * sitemap, while the new write-up asks to be indexed too. It is also an orphan
 * on the day it ships, which is the bug `raceWriteups.ts` was written to end.
 *
 * Reading the directory is what makes this catch the omission: deriving the
 * list from the registry would be the same blind spot in a second place.
