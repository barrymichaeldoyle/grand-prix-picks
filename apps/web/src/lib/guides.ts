          'The elimination structure is what makes it compelling. A driver on the edge of the cut has to commit to a fast lap in traffic with the clock running out, and a small mistake ends their session immediately. Track conditions usually improve as more rubber goes down, which adds a timing element: going out too early can cost a place, and going out too late risks not completing a lap at all.',
