 * more usefully, gives each section an edge the eye can tell from the last.
 *
 * The DOM order does not change: copy first, photo second, in every section,
 * mirrored or not. That is what a screen reader and a phone both get, and both
 * want the story before the illustration. The swap is grid placement only,
 * which is why the copy and photo blocks each name their column explicitly
 * rather than relying on the order they appear in.
 *
 * The cost of that is a tab through a mirrored section going right to left: the
 * source link in the copy, then the credit under the photo beside it. It is the
 * right trade. Reordering the DOM would fix the focus path and break the two
 * things that matter more — the stacking order on a phone, where the picture

 * questions whose answers outlive the race: when it runs, how scoring works,
 * and what a grid penalty does to a classification.
 *
 * `finished` changes exactly one of them: the one that states a date. The
 * scoring rules and the privacy of a pick read the same before and after a
 * race, so branching the whole list would be three copies of identical prose
 * carrying one verb. An archive that still says the race "runs" this weekend is

 * The whole 2026 slick range, hardest first, not just the three nominated here.

 * Five compounds is the entire scale: Pirelli dropped the C6 for 2026 on the
 * grounds that it sat too close to the C5, so C1 to C5 is all there is and the
 * page's claim that Monza gets the soft end of the range is something the strip
 * can now show rather than assert. `role` is the tyre's job *at this race* and
 * is therefore relative: C3 is the hard tyre at Monza while sitting in the
 * middle of the range, which is the distinction the scale exists to make.
 *
 * A null `role` means the compound is not nominated for this race. Its band is
 * null with it, because the white / yellow / red sidewall is painted on the
 * three tyres that turn up, not on a place in the range.
 *
 * The colours are Pirelli's sidewall bands, which makes them data about the
 * sport rather than palette decisions: the same standing as a team's livery in
 * `tokens.ts`, and read the same way, as a thin band and never as a fill. They
 * are local to this page because nothing else in the app names a compound yet;
 * the second surface that does should move them into the shared tokens beside
 * `teams`.

 *
 * What it deliberately does not do is repeat the forecast. The schedule card
 * in the hero above serves live numbers that move, and a hand-typed 36°C
 * beside a component saying 33°C is the page arguing with itself. The threshold
 * and the regulation are what the component cannot say, so they are what is
 * here.
 *
 * Outside the `isLive` block, unlike the liveries and the seat news. Those stop
 * mattering the moment the race starts; a heat hazard is half the explanation
 * of the result, so a reader arriving at the finished page to work out why a
 * one-stop turned into two still needs it. That decides the tense: the
 * declaration is stated as something that happened, and the regulation as what
 * a heat hazard does, so neither sentence needs revisiting on Sunday night.
 *
 * `showPickRead` is the one part that does expire. "Read FP2" is advice for
 * somebody still choosing, and it is worse than useless once the grid has
 * formed, so it is the only paragraph the phase gates.
