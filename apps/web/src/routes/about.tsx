            Grand Prix Picks is a free prediction game for Formula 1 race
            weekends. You rank the five drivers you expect to finish at the
            front of each session, choose who will finish ahead in each team,
            and score points based on how close you were. Your results carry
            across the season on a global leaderboard and in any private leagues
            you join.
          </p>
          <p className="gpp-reading-copy mt-4 text-text-muted">
            There is no gambling here and no real-money betting of any kind. You
            cannot stake money on an outcome, and there is nothing to cash out.
            The game is free to play in full. An optional Season Pass raises the
            limits on how many leagues you can create and join, and that is the
            only thing money buys.

            Every session is scored against the official FIA classification
            rather than the order cars crossed the line. That distinction
            matters: post-race penalties change the classification, and when
            they do, affected sessions are rescored so that the game reflects
            the result that actually counts for the championship.

          <p className="gpp-reading-copy mt-4 text-text-muted">
            Published results are automatically reconciled against timing data
            after each session to catch late amendments. The full policy,
            including how grid penalties are handled differently from post-race
            penalties, is written up on the{' '}
