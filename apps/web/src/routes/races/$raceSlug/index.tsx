/**
 * Swallow a loader query the page can render without.
 *
 * A rejected loader promise is a fatal 500 on Cloudflare — only dev recovers
 * from an SSR throw — so every query on this loader's critical path is a way
 * for the most important page on the site to go down. The race, the roster and
 * the results have to be there, and legitimately take the page with them if
 * they fail. The consensus tables and the "predictions open" date do not: both
 * are supplementary, both have a client subscription behind them that fills
 * them in, and a transient `fetch failed` on one should cost a section rather
 * than the page.
 *
 * Leaving the cache unprimed is the point — the client then fetches normally.
