    question: 'Why is the 2026 Bahrain Grand Prix being held in Malaysia?',
    answer:
      'The round was due to run at Sakhir in April and was called off on safety grounds, along with the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. Formula 1, the FIA and the governments of Bahrain and Malaysia agreed to reinstate it at Sepang in October. It keeps the Bahrain Grand Prix name, and Bahrain sets the ticket prices and receives the ticket revenue.',

    question: 'When is the 2026 Bahrain Grand Prix?',

          Sepang was slotted between Azerbaijan and Singapore, so the teams run
          three races in three weekends and travel from Baku to Malaysia to
          Singapore. Two of the three are hot and humid, and the third is a
          street circuit.

          Reliability and damage carry across a run like this. A car that breaks
          in Baku may take a penalty here, and a driver who struggles with the
          heat here has Singapore a week later. Singapore is also a sprint
          weekend, so it has four sessions to pick rather than two.
