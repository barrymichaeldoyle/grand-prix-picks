/**
 * Everything the signed-in dashboard needs above the fold, in one query.
 *
 * This exists for SSR. The dashboard's own components each read their own
 * query (`races.getCurrentWeekend`, `users.me`, and the two pick queries), and
 * on the client that is right — four independent subscriptions, each updating
 * on its own. On the server it was the reason the page could not be rendered:
 * the picks query needs a raceId that only the weekend query can supply, so
 * fetching them over HTTP would have cost two serial round trips, and SSR time
 * on this route is almost entirely one round trip to Convex. Two would have
 * bought a rendered dashboard by making every signed-in page slower to start.
 *
 * Inside a single query that dependency is free: it is one transaction on one
 * consistent snapshot, so the raceId is just a local variable. One round trip,
 * everything filled in.
 *
 * Every field is the *same value* the individual query returns, because each
 * comes from that query's own extracted body rather than a re-derivation. The
 * web app seeds its query cache from this payload under the individual queries'
 * cache keys, so a drift here would seed a shape the live subscription then
 * contradicts on its first update.
 *
 * Returns null for a signed-out caller, which is also what an expired token
 * produces — the caller treats both as "nothing to seed" and falls back to
 * client fetching.
