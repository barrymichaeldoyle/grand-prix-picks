 * come off the feed before lights out. All of that already exists on a news
 * record, and a second table would have been a second copy of every one of
 * those behaviours.
 *
 * Stored as codes and positions only. Who drives for whom is round-scoped, so
 * a stored name or team would be a second copy of a moving fact; the resolved
 * shape below is built at read time for the write-up and frozen into the feed
 * event, exactly as `driverCodes` and `newsDrivers` already are.

   *
   * Only the key is stored. The reader's copy is resolved from the item itself
